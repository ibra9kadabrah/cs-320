We ensure our software is functional and secure by conducting functional testing, non-functional testing, unit testing, integration testing, system testing and acceptance testing. But thats not enough, we also need to ensure we are collecting software requirements and keeping it updates as well as following good security practices like code reviews and conducting static analysis.

We interpert user needs by conducting interviews with stakeholders and collecting requirements. We incorporate user needs by following an agile development software development method which allows for iterative development and refinement. One crucial step is to also conduct user testing to validate the software.

We approach designing software by collecting requirements, following design methodologies like agile to ensure our system can be continouasly updated. We should also Make UML diagrams to represent the system as were taught in cs-255 as it can greatly help simplify the design process.
